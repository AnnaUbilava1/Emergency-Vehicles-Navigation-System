# üö® Smart Emergency Navigation System

## Overview

The Smart Emergency Navigation System aims to provide real-time optimized routing for emergency vehicles, considering traffic conditions, road types, weather, accidents, and other factors that influence travel time. The system uses a combination of Bayesian networks and traffic data from APIs (Google Maps or mock data) to calculate the best routes for emergency vehicles, minimizing response times during critical situations.

## üöó Problem Statement

Urban traffic congestion often causes critical delays for emergency vehicles like ambulances and fire trucks, putting lives and property at risk. Traditional GPS systems are reactive and do not prioritize emergency-specific needs such as signal preemption, lane privileges, or intelligent rerouting during incidents.

---

## Project Goals

- Design an AI system that **predicts**, **adapts**, and **reroutes** emergency vehicles in real time.
- Integrate real-world traffic APIs to dynamically reflect changing conditions.
- Use Bayesian reasoning to anticipate delays before they become visible.
- Simulate real-world response time improvements of 20‚Äì30%.

## AI & ML Techniques Used

### üîç Search Algorithms

- **A\*** and **Dijkstra** for shortest pathfinding on a city road network.
- **Dynamic edge weights** that reflect emergency speed, traffic lights, lane access, and congestion.

### Bayesian Network

- Predicts traffic congestion based on:
  - `TimeOfDay`, `Weather`, `Accident`, `RoadType`
- Provides a **congestion score** used to penalize risky routes.
- Enhances **reasoning under uncertainty** and supports proactive rerouting.

## Demo: What It Does

- Calculates both **emergency** and **regular** routes from origin to destination.
- Injects a simulated **accident** mid-route and reroutes emergency vehicles.
- Generates visual comparisons:
  - Traffic heatmap
  - Bayesian congestion prediction
  - Route overlays
  - Time-saving bar charts

## üìà Example Results

- üïí **42% faster** response time with emergency privileges and rerouting
- üöß Avoided central bottlenecks intelligently during accident simulation
- üìä Visual evidence generated in plots: `plot_*.png`

## How to Run

### 1. Install Requirements

```bash
pip install networkx matplotlib numpy pgmpy requests folium
```

### 2. Run the Simulation

```bash
python new.py
```

This runs a full simulation and generates result plots in the working directory.

To use live traffic:

Get a Google Maps API key

In new.py, update:

```bash
CONFIG = {
    'google_maps_api_key': 'YOUR_KEY_HERE',
    'use_mock_data': False,
}
```

‚ö†Ô∏è API calls may be rate-limited. Mock traffic simulation is enabled by default.
